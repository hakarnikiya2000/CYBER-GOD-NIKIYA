Create a modern, dark-themed landing page for a cybersecurity professional and web developer with the handle "CYBER GOD NIKIYA". The website should feel high-tech, powerful, and sleek, like a command center or a futuristic terminal.

**Core Details:**
- Name/Handle: CYBER GOD NIKIYA
- Profession: Web Developer & Cybersecurity Expert
- Tagline: "Securing the Future, One Line of Code at a Time"

**Design & Aesthetic:**
- **Color Palette:** Primary colors should be black (#0a0a0a) and neon green (#00ff41) or electric blue (#00e0ff). Use dark grey (#1a1a1a) for cards/containers.
- **Typography:** Use a monospace font (like 'Fira Code', 'JetBrains Mono', or 'Courier New') for a coding/terminal feel.
- **Atmosphere:**
    - A subtle, animated matrix-like rain effect or a glowing particle network in the background.
    - Glitch effects on the main name or tagline on hover.
    - CRT scan lines or a subtle vignette overlay to give a monitor/display feel.
    - Icons representing code, shields, locks, and nodes.

**Layout & Sections (HTML/CSS/JS Structure):**

1.  **Header/Navigation:**
    - Logo: "[CGN]" or a simple skull/crosshair icon with a circuit pattern.
    - Navigation links: Home, Skills, Arsenal (Services), Contact.
    - A "Decrypt" button (styled as a green-outlined button that glows).

2.  **Hero Section:**
    - A large, glitchy animated text that reads: `> Initializing CYBER GOD NIKIYA...`
    - Below that, a blinking cursor next to the text: `> Access Granted.`
    - A brief intro: "Web Developer by day. Security Architect by night. I build secure systems and find vulnerabilities before the bad guys do."

3.  **Skills/Arsenal Section:**
    - Title: `// DEPLOYED_WEAPONS`
    - Display skills as "tags" or "commands" in a grid. Examples:
        - `[PENTEST]` - `[REACT.JS]` - `[NODE]` - `[CRYPTO]` - `[NETWORK_SEC]` - `[PYTHON]`
        - `[WEB_DEV]` - `[REVERSE_ENG]` - `[CLOUD]`

4.  **Featured Work / Projects:**
    - Create 3 cards that look like terminal windows.
    - Card 1: `> Project_Firewall.log` - Description of a secure web app built.
    - Card 2: `> Vuln_Scan.res` - Description of a bug bounty or security audit.
    - Card 3: `> CGN_Toolkit.js` - Description of a custom dev tool.

5.  **Footer / Contact:**
    - Title: `> ESTABLISH_CONNECTION`
    - Contact email: `nikiya@cybergod.dev` (or a placeholder).
    - Links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and HackerOne styled as ascii icons.
    - A small copyright in the matrix-green font: `© 2024 CYBER GOD NIKIYA // All rights secured.`

**Interactive Elements (JavaScript):**
- Add a live date/time stamp in the header that updates in real-time, formatted like a server timestamp (e.g., `[SERVER_TIME: 20:14:37]`).
- When the user types any key on the page, a small console log appears in the corner saying `> [KEY_PRESS] logged...` or just an Easter egg that opens an alert saying "Accessing mainframe..." after typing a secret word like "nika".

**Tone:** Dark, confident, professional, and slightly mysterious.
